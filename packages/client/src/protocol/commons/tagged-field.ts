/**
 * Note that KIP-482 tagged fields can be added to a request without incrementing the version number. This offers
 * an additional way of evolving the message schema without breaking compatibility. Tagged fields do not take up
 * any space when the field is not set. Therefore, if a field is rarely used, it is more efficient to make it a
 * tagged field than to put it in the mandatory schema. However, tagged fields are ignored by recipients that don't
 * know about them, which could pose a challenge if this is not the behavior that the sender wants.
 * In such cases, a version bump may be more appropriate.
 *
 * Each tagged field begins with a tag header.
 *
 * The tag header contains two unsigned variable-length integers.
 *    The first one contains the field's tag.
 *    The second one is the length of the field.
 *
